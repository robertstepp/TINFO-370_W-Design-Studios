			<p>We are W Design Studios. We strive to help those in need of medical supplies attain them in a time that they're needed the most. 
			How is this done? Through the power of distributed manufacturing and 3d-printing. We will collaborate with the 3D printing community 
			to deliver supplies to those in need. We offer the necessary files to print said supplies and directions to properly sanitize to 
			FDA regulations.</p>
